# Premium Features in Airbnb Listings

## Introduction
- Airbnb is a vacation rental online marketplace
- It's mission is to help create a world where you can belong anywhere and where people can live in a place, instead of just traveling to it.
- Hosts are able to set their own prices with the help from Airnb algorithms

    This study is to investigate and evaluate how the hosts are leveraging different features of a renting property to set the prices. In other words, what features of a property is important to the hosts and what do they deem valueable when considering a property as a rental property? More importantly, how can we identify the features the hosts used to justify a higher price point? In this study, we will define such features as **premium features**.   
  
    The dataset used to tackle this question is from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html),a website created by Murray Cox. This study will use datasets of NYC collected on August 19th 2019 and apply machine learing techniques to identify premium features. This dataset and the preprocessed dataset can be also be found on this [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10YZMuBSQ3WaaT77UT2nNNkRryV5G0QnU?usp=sharing).
